# Social [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://makeapullrequest.com)

A python package that uses OpenAI to generate a response to a social media mention. It uses Google Sentiment Analysis to analyze the sentiment of the incoming message. 

I'm currently just using this for Twitter. Insta replies as a new comment on the post. Reddit works too I think.

See my twitter replies for an example: https://twitter.com/RiversCuomo/with_replies

## Installation

Depending on which of the 3 social media platforms you want to use, you'll register for the appropriate API keys. 

## Environment Variables

You can specify custom variables to include using a `.env` file.  Alternatively, you can set them as Environment Variables.

### API Credentials
